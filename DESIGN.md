# kotlinJT — decision record

This file is the project's decision record (established with the Layer 0 package, issue #2).
Every load-bearing decision lands here with its rationale; reversals quote the old rationale.
Architecture and principles live in `README.md`; scope in issue #1. Nothing in here is a
permanent non-goal — deferred work states the condition under which its time comes.

Spec references are to the *JT File Format Reference v10.0 Rev-C* (the withdrawn but
installed-base-authoritative ISO 14306:2017 text). "The fixture" below is the local
real-producer file: JT 9.5, written by NetAllied JTWriter R14, 48 192 bytes, little-endian
(gitignored under `fixtures-local/`, see the amendment on issue #1).

## Toolchain

Gradle 8.7 / Kotlin Multiplatform 1.9.24 / ktlint plugin 12.1.1 — the combination proven in
the sibling project (ConstructIt) on the same development machine. Deliberately conservative:
the library's value is format fidelity, not compiler novelty. Upgrade when a feature needs it
(e.g. kotlinx-io versions past 0.3.x require Kotlin 2.x klibs).

Targets: `jvm()` and `js(IR) { nodejs() }`, both with tests. A browser JS target is a future
extension; its time comes when a browser consumer exists (the ConstructIt seam) — nothing in
`commonMain` blocks it.

## Byte I/O: kotlinx-io at the edge, own cursor at the core

**Decision**: dependency on `kotlinx-io-core` (0.3.5, the last Kotlin-1.9-compatible line),
used only at the entry point (`readJtFile(path)`: multiplatform file reading on JVM and
Node). The parsing core runs on our own `ByteReader`/`ByteWriter` over `ByteArray`
(`de.haumacher.kotlinjt.io`), plus an immutable `Bytes` value type for payloads.

**Why not okio**: both libraries are stream-oriented and big-endian-native. JT demands
*per-file* byte order (a header byte selects it, clause 5.1.1) and TOC-driven random access —
neither library models that, so a thin cursor of our own was needed either way. Given that
the dependency only covers the filesystem edge, the lighter, KMP-first, kotlinx-ecosystem
library wins. okio's maturity advantage is neutralized by the seam being one file.

**Why not zero dependencies**: file access in `commonMain` without platform types is exactly
what kotlinx-io provides; hand-rolling it would re-implement the library behind an
`expect`/`actual` of our own. Risk recorded: kotlinx-io is pre-1.0; its types do not appear
in the public API, so churn is contained to `JtFiles.kt`.

## zlib seam

`expect fun zlibInflate(ByteArray): ByteArray` / `zlibDeflate(ByteArray, level)` in
`de.haumacher.kotlinjt.codec`, throwing a common `ZlibException` on corrupt/truncated input.

- **JVM**: `java.util.zip.Inflater`/`Deflater`. Note the inflate loop: `inflate()` can return
  0 *because the stream just finished* — check `finished()` before diagnosing truncation
  (this was a real defect caught by the empty-payload round-trip test).
- **JS**: pako 2.1.0 via `npm()`. pako throws plain JS *strings* on corrupt input, which a
  Kotlin `catch (e: Throwable)` never sees on the IR backend — the try/catch lives on the JS
  side of the boundary (a `js()` wrapper in `Zlib.js.kt`) and converts to `ZlibException`.
  (A second real defect caught by the hostile-input tests on JS.)

Deflate level defaults to 6 — the default of both engines, and (observed) the level that
byte-reproduces the fixture's LSG stream when re-deflating its inflated payload. Layer 0
losslessness does **not** depend on that: re-serialization always emits the raw payload
bytes; deflation is only for the future writer and for tests.

All segment-wide codecs sit behind one interface, `SegmentCodec`, registered by the U8
Compression Algorithm value: 1 = none, 2 = ZLIB, 3 = LZMA. Decoding never throws through the
API: a codec returns `CodecResult.Decoded` or `CodecResult.Refused(note)`.

- **LZMA (v10, clause 12.2.5) is a named future extension**, not implemented. Its time comes
  with the first v10 fixture that uses it. Until then a segment flagged LZMA loads with note
  `UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION` and its raw bytes fully accessible — and re-serializes
  byte-identically.

## Load notes — refusals speak

`LoadNote` is a sealed hierarchy of immutable data classes; each subtype has a **stable name**
(`UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION`, `UNKNOWN_SEGMENT_TYPE`, `SEGMENT_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`, …) and a
located, human-readable message. The contract:

- **Silence means success.** Anything the parser cannot fully decode is a note; there are no
  unnamed notes by construction, and no exceptions escape `JtFile.parse` for segment-local
  problems. Raw bytes are always preserved next to a refusal.
- `JtFormatException` is reserved for the top-level "this cannot be a JT file" cases:
  unreadable header, unusable TOC. Hostile-input tests pin both halves of this line.
- The fixture suite asserts each fixture's exact note-name list against its sidecar; a
  well-formed file asserts the empty list.

The base class's `toString()` is `final` so the data-class field dump can never replace the
`NAME: message` diagnostic rendering (a data class regenerates `toString` unless the
inherited one is final — a third defect the gate caught).

## Layer 0 losslessness: the region model

A parsed `JtFile` holds the header plus an ordered list of `FileRegion`s covering
`[headerLength, fileSize)` completely: `SegmentRegion` (per TOC entry), `TocRegion`, and
`GapRegion` for any bytes no TOC entry explains (preserved verbatim, flagged by note
`UNMAPPED_REGION`). A region starting inside an already-covered range (duplicate or hostile
TOC entries) is parsed but marked *shadowed* — inspectable, excluded from layout, its bytes
emitted by the covering region; the uncovered remainder, if any, falls out as a gap. This is
what makes *parse → serialize byte-identical* hold for damaged files too, which the
hostile-input tests assert for every note kind.

What is structurally re-serialized from parsed fields: file header (version bytes preserved
verbatim, empty field preserved as read per clause 4.3), TOC (entry order preserved), segment
headers (GUID, type, declared length — preserved even when they contradict the TOC, with
mismatch notes). What is emitted raw: segment payloads (including the 9 compression-header
bytes, which are additionally *parsed* as a view). Re-layout after mutation is Layer 1's
concern; `serialize()` `check`s layout contiguity so a mutated model fails loudly rather than
writing a corrupt file.

Element framing (`scanElements`) is deliberately a **diagnostic view, not a decode claim**:
segment data is walked as consecutive element lists (I32 length ≥ 16, then Object Type ID
GUID; the all-FF GUID ends a list), and the first unrecognizable position starts the
preserved `trailing` bytes. The write path never goes through the scan, so a conservative
scan can never lose bytes. A known-type segment whose data yields *no* frame at all is
flagged `ELEMENT_STREAM_UNRECOGNIZED`.

## v9 vs v10 structural deltas (established, with byte evidence from the fixture)

The v10 reference documents only the v10 wire format. The deltas below were verified against
the fixture's bytes; width selection keys on the header's version string (`major >= 10` ⇒
wide), `JtVersion.wideOffsets`.

1. **File header TOC Offset: I32 in v9, U64 in v10** (clause 5.1.1 shows U64).
   Evidence: I32 little-endian at offset 85 = 47 824; the TOC parsed there has 13 entries and
   ends exactly at the 48 192-byte file end. A U64 read at 85 consumes the first GUID half
   and yields garbage. v9 header is therefore 105 bytes: `Version[80]`, `UChar` byte order,
   `I32` empty field, `I32` TOC offset, `GUID` LSG segment id — and the fixture's first
   segment starts at offset 105 exactly.
2. **No conditional trailing header GUID in v9.** v10's Figure 11 appends a `GUID` empty
   field when the I32 empty field ≠ 0; implemented for v10 (unit-tested both branches),
   absent in v9 (fixture: first segment at 105 leaves no room).
3. **TOC entry: 28 bytes in v9 (GUID, I32 offset, I32 length, U32 attributes) vs 32 bytes in
   v10 (GUID, U64 offset, U32 length, U32 attributes)** (clause 5.1.2 shows the latter).
   Evidence: 4 + 13 × 28 = 368 bytes from 47 824 lands exactly on the file end; each entry's
   offset/length match the segment header GUID and length found at that offset. With 32-byte
   entries the second entry's GUID would start mid-field.
4. **Segment-wide compression is ZLIB in v9, LZMA in v10.** v10's Tables 8/9 say flag 3 /
   algorithm 3 = LZMA, algorithm 1 = none; the v9 generation used flag 2 / algorithm 2 =
   ZLIB with the same field layout (U32 flag, I32 compressed data length *including* the
   algorithm byte, U8 algorithm). Evidence: the fixture's LSG segment data begins
   `02 00 00 00 | C7 07 00 00 | 02 | 78 9C…` — flag 2, length 1991, algorithm 2, then a zlib
   stream (`78 9C`) that inflates to 8 663 bytes of well-formed element lists; 9 + (1991 − 1)
   bytes exactly fill the segment payload. The codec registry accepts both generations by
   dispatching on the algorithm byte.
5. **Element framing is shared.** Both generations frame elements as I32 length + that many
   bytes starting with the Object Type ID GUID, end-of-elements GUID all-FF. Evidence: the
   fixture's uncompressed Shape LOD0 segments and its *inflated* LSG data both walk cleanly:
   each shape segment = 1 element + end marker + 6 trailing bytes; the LSG = 67 graph
   elements + end marker + 42 property atoms + end marker + 694 bytes of non-element-framed
   tail (the property table — Layer 1 will interpret it).

### Recorded observations, not yet interpreted

- **Six trailing bytes `01 00 00 00 00 00` after the end-of-elements marker in every one of
  the fixture's 12 shape segments.** Not derivable from the v10 text; possibly a v9 shape
  segment field. Carried verbatim by Layer 0 (inside the raw payload; visible in the
  inventory as `trailing 6 B`). To be interpreted when Layer 1 reads v9 shape LODs.
- **Compression fields with flag ∉ {2,3}** (compression off): the fields are still read and
  the remaining `dataLength − 1` bytes treated as plain element data. Spec-derived
  (Figure 19 shows the fields unconditionally on the first element), fixture-unverified —
  the fixture always compresses. If a real file contradicts this, the framing falls back to
  a `COMPRESSION_HEADER_INCONSISTENT` note with raw bytes preserved, so nothing can be lost
  meanwhile.
- The v9.5 element header may or may not carry the v10 `I32 Object ID` after the base-type
  byte; Layer 0 does not parse past the base type, so nothing depends on it yet. Decide when
  Layer 1 parses element bodies.

## Fixture conventions (from the amendment on issue #1)

- JVM-only `FixtureDiscoveryTest` auto-discovers `fixtures-local/*.jt` (repo root found by
  walking up to `settings.gradle.kts`/`.git`). Battery per file: parse with exactly the
  sidecar's note names (empty for a healthy file); inventory JSON — including per-payload
  SHA-256 — equal to the sidecar `<name>.expected.json` (created on first run for human
  review, asserted thereafter); byte-identical re-serialization.
- No fixtures ⇒ one visibly **SKIPPED** test whose name carries the count. Verified.
- Committed code never names a fixture file (customer part numbers). Sidecars live next to
  the fixtures, equally gitignored.
- Committed conformance lives in the synthetic round-trip suite (both byte orders, both
  version generations, hostile variants) — regression pinning, not conformance proof, per the
  "your own writer proves nothing" doctrine.
